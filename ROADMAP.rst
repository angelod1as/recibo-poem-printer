Recibo, the Poem Printer
============================================

Roadmap
=======

The software development has the following roadmap:

Proof of concept
----------------

1. [DONE] The printer should succesfully print a accented string (``latin-1``) after a program command.

Custom text
-----------

1. [DONE] The program should read from a ``.txt`` file
2. [DONE] The program should format the result from ``read`` accordingly.
3. [DONE] The printer should print succesfully the generated string by the program.

More folders, more texts
------------------------

1. [DONE] The program should read from two folders: ``short-stories`` and ``poems``
2. [DONE] The program should format each file accordingly.
3. [DONE] The printer should print a random text from a single folder after a command.
4. [DONE] The printer should print a random text from a single folder after a key press.

Images
------

1. [DONE] The program should read a ``bitmap`` image.
2. [DONE] The program should format the image accordingly (Maybe here I'll simplify the process by creating mandatory image pre-formatting rules)
3. [DONE] The program should print the image after a command or key press (as it should be already implemented as seen above)
4. [DONE] The program should read, format and print a random image from the ``images`` folder succesfully
