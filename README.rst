Before anything
---------------

This is my very first python script. This project is open-source and built for free, but I'd love to be referenced if you fork it/use it anywhere else.

I'd love to see my work being used in other places.

Thanks
======

**First:**

Thanks to `Casa 1 <https://www.casaum.org/>`_. They financed this project through buying the necessary hardware.

If you have money to spare, consider donating to them. They are a home for LGBTQ+ people that were denied housing and rights.

**Second:**

This thing only works because of the amazing help from `Belono <https://github.com/belono>`_ and the `Python ESC/POS <https://github.com/python-escpos/python-escpos/>`_ contributors.

Many thanks to `Cuducos <https://github.com/cuducos>`_ for Python tools and clarification on some doubts. Thanks to `Jonas Marques <https://twitter.com/jonassmarques>`_ for his tips and answers to my many (many!) questions.

PRs are encouraged and appreciated.
